<p>I recently decided to pick up a Windows machine and I really liked the idea of having a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">2 in 1</a>.  So I did my research and purchased an <a class="reference external" href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/aspireswitch11">Acer</a> Switch 11.  Overall I have been very happy with this little laptop/tablet.  Knowing that I would be using this for development I got the model with a 500GB HD in the keyboard.  Unfortunately this model only came with 32GB on the primary disk.</p>
<p>My end goal was to be able to install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Community Edition</a> on this machine for use in the Laptop mode, but not necessarily in tablet mode.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried to do was to remove the recovery partition.  For some reason the OEM version of Windows provided with the Acer Switch did not allow for that.  Every time I tried to remove the partition it would prevent the OS from booting.  A quick Google search showed that this was a fairly common problem.  Fortunately I had a retail version Windows, so I hooked up a USB DVD drive and started from scratch.  I was able to create single partition for the OS and start the install.  Everything worked great...</p>
<p>...Almost, when the retail version of Windows booted the touch screen was no longer working.  So back to the Acer site and a quick download and install of the Intel platform drivers got everything back to working.  I still did not have Visual Studio installed.</p>
<p>My first attempted at installing Visual Studio to the D: drive failed.  While the primary interface was installed on the D: drive the bulk of the other content is still installed on the C: drive.  So I still need more space.  Next I added in a 64GB micro SD card and Robocopy'd my users directory to it.  To do this I created a local user with admin privileges and logged in as him. Then I removed the original home directory, and created a link to the home directory on the F: drive.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_1f5235f634144df392ba8509aa1071ff-1"></a>robocopy /COPYALL /MIR /XJ c:\Users\Peter f:\Users\Peter
<a name="rest_code_1f5235f634144df392ba8509aa1071ff-2"></a>rd /S /Q c:\Users\Peter
<a name="rest_code_1f5235f634144df392ba8509aa1071ff-3"></a>mklink /J c:\Users\Peter f:\Users\Peter
</pre>
<p>When that was done I logged back in as myself, removed the local user and everything is working again.  But I still don't have a working version of Visual Studio.  I needed more space.  Then I downloaded <a class="reference external" href="http://windirstat.info/">WinDirStat</a> to analyze what was eating the most space.  It was the Visual Studio Package Cache in the ProgramData directory.  I had read that this was not something that should be removed and that it was needed for Visual Studio to work.  So I applied the same process that I used with my home directory to the package cache.  Robocopy the files to the D: drive, remove the files from the C: drive and link the D: drive files back to C: drive.  Now I was able to repair the installation of Visual Studio and fire it up.</p>
<p>I did this process two more times with the Windows SDKs and Microsoft Kits and now I have a healthy 3GB of the 32GB on the C: drive my users directory has over 50GB left on in and Visual Studio work when I am docked with the Keyboard and actually need it.</p>
<p>I was always an extensive user of the <code>ln -s</code> soft links in Posix operating system.  I am not sure when <code>mklink</code> got added to the OS but I really appreciate the capabilities it provides.</p>
