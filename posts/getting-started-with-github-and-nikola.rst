I finally took the time to get set up with Github_ pages and Nikola_ blogging.  

I am still a little curious how the git_hub deploy task works, and why it rquires multiple branches.

I am looking forward to trying out the ipython_ notebook support and I would like to see if I can created some doit_ tasks for publishing to Tumblr_ and the Jive_ platform.
